The City of Newark open data portal has an some interesting datasets we might work with and create some kind of spatial/map visualization. The datasets range across infrastructure, government, demographics, business, education and public safety but here are some datasets I found more interesting.

- [Abandoned Properties](http://data.ci.newark.nj.us/dataset/abandoned-properties)
  - Contains latitute and longitude data.
  - Former owner's (individual/corporation) name.
- [Wards](http://data.ci.newark.nj.us/dataset/wards)
  - This is shapefile that we can use to generate the actual map of Newark in the browser.
- [Health Inspections](http://data.ci.newark.nj.us/dataset/health-inspections)
  - Contains latitute and longitude data.
  - Grade and date inspected.

There is also data on [NHA Project Housing](http://data.ci.newark.nj.us/dataset/nha-projects), the [Valentine's Day Property Sale](http://data.ci.newark.nj.us/dataset/valentine-s-day-property-sale), [Newark Census](http://data.ci.newark.nj.us/dataset/newark-census-block-group-polygon) and distribution of [Taxes Paid](http://data.ci.newark.nj.us/dataset/taxes-paid-2014), all interesting stuff with potentially even more interesting insights in an overlapping visualization.

This open data project could definetly bring some synergy to the voting app project that we are thinking of starting. Essentially, trying to inform voters with these visualizations before they go to the polls.
